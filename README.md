# Automatically Identifying Prediction Errors of Home Mortgage Loans

When issuing loans, mortgage sellers are interested in protecting themselves against large forecasting errors. Although advances in statistical methods have allowed analysts to achieve relatively low prediction errors, exceptionally large and unlikely errors are still pervasive threats to otherwise sound portfolios. However, given a dataset of loans, it is possible to develop a machine learning model to foresee such exceptionally large errors, termed “hotspots”, in advance. In this paper, I demonstrate an ensemble machine learning model that performs exceptionally well at identifying prediction hotspots for loan defaults, balances, and prepayments. Scores for each class generate precision, recall, and accuracy levels that are nearly prefect. Furthermore, unlike popular methods like deep learning, the model is developed in such a way that intuition is not lost in a black box.
